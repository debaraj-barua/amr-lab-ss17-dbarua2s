Feedback
========

- Good submission.

- In the follow_wall state, sometimes a door is detected as an uneven wall, causing it to sometimes go through the door sideways (sometimes even going beyond, and loosing the current wall). Probably this can be corrected by first aligning to the wall and then adjusting to the desired clearance.
