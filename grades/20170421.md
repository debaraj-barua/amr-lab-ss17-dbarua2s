-  Check time report format and folder.

- Angular speed of differential robot uses distance between wheels, not radius.

- By convention, positive angular velocity is counter-clockwise, so angular velocity should be ( V_right_wheel - V_left_wheel ) * wheel_diameter / distance_between_wheels.

- wheel_diameter parameter is not used in the twist calculation. Yes, this doesn't change the behavior for BV, but it is necessary for the job the *differential\_drive\_emulator* does: it should provide correct mapping of the wheel speeds to the robot movement.
